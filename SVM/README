The only files needed are vocab.tfidf, model.svm, and SentiMintSVM.py

To use the SVM predictor you will need to import SntiMintSVM.py amd create a sntimintSVM object.
You then call the predict function from that object and pass the string to be analyzed. 
You can see test.py for an example

vocab.tfidf and model.svm should be in the same directory as SentiMintSVM.py and should NOT be renamed
